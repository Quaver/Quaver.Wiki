# Quaver Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 14th, 2018

## General information

This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content (“Services”).

By using our Service, you confirm that you have read the Terms of Service and the following privacy policy. If you do not wish for us to collect or process your infromation as described, do not use our Services.

## Information We Collect

### Upon Registering an Account

When registering for an account in-game, we collect your username, Steam identification number, and internet protocol address.

### Upon uploading user published content

When posting content to our services, using our in-game chat, or posting comments on our mapset submission system, you are effectively publishing information for the public to see. We store and publicize this information as provided by the user. In some cases this information cannot be deleted by the user - such as when user published content goes into ranked status.

### Using our Game Client

When logging into our servers on the game client and submitting scores, we collect your ip address, hashed versions of hardware and client identifiers as well as game client configurations. This information contains no personal identifiable information and is used solely to track user access across our services. We collect this information to help keep unfair players off of the game for the purpose of maintaining leaderboard integrity and to further enforce account security. 

When submitting scores to our game servers, replay data may also be sent. This allows us to publically display your replays for scores on leaderboards and user profiles. This data cannot be deleted or modified in any shape or form.

### Analytics

As you use our services, we collect error logs as well as web analytics that give us information about technical and usage information. This information might include your username, ip address, browser information, and operating system.

These logs are only stored if deemed useful for technical purposes.

### Steam

By using our official game client, Steam may collect its own personal information. This Privacy Policy covers use of information stored by Quaver only and not information by third parties.

## Disclosure of your information

We will never sell your personal information.

We will only share your personal information if it is for the purposes of where you have made it public or to improve our service.

## Cookies

We use cookies and similar technologies such as local storage to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language), evaluate email effectiveness, and personalize information.

Some third-party services that we use, such as embedly or Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Quaver only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

## Modifying your personal information or deleting your account

If you have a Quaver account, you can access and modify your personal information.

To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

If you are in the European Union, you have the choice of deleting your account. To do this, you must email us at <support@quavergame.com> and request this. When deleting your account, any information published publically as stated in the privacy policy will not be deleted. Furthermore, we only allow one account to be created by a user for maintaining leaderboard integrity. Once deleting your account, you will not be able to return to Quaver. This means we will be also storing your hashed client and hardware identifiers as mentioned in this privacy policy.

## Data security

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site and game servers. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your Steam account.

## No Children

Quaver is only for people 13 years old and over. By using Quaver, you affirm that you are over 13. If we learn someone under 13 is using Quaver, we’ll terminate their account and delete their personal information from our servers.

## Changes to this Policy

Quaver may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be here and we will archive former versions of the policy here.
