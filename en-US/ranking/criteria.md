# Quaver Ranking Criteria

In order to get a mapset ranked, it must follow the criteria listed below. In the event that it does not, you may be asked to modify your mapset and resubmit it again for rank.

If you're looking for the process of getting a mapset ranked, see: [Quaver Ranking Process](/docs/Ranking/Process).

# Pattern terms
* **Anchor**: A pattern that has a relatively high amount of notes in one column compared with another column, usually found within different types of streams.
* **Bracket**: A pattern that involves multiple trills using columns near each other.
* **Chord**: Two or more notes pressed at the same time.
* **Chordstream (Jumpstream, Handstream, Quadstream)**: Streams that mix different types of chords.
* **Grace**: Two or more notes pressed in rapid succession, generally using snaps at or above 1/6.
* **Hand**: Three notes pressed at the same time. Occasionally referred to as a "triple".
* **Jack**: Three or more consecutive notes in the same column, usually pressed at a faster pace than surrounding notes.
* **Jump**: Two notes pressed at the same time. Occasionally referred to as a "double".
* **Jumptrill**: A trill consisting of two alternating jumps.
* **Minijack**: Two consecutive notes in the same column, usually pressed at a faster pace compared to surrounding notes.
* **Release**: The end of a long note which must be released within a certain timing window to score the entirety of the note properly.
* **Roll**: A variation of a stream consisting of notes that go from the first to the last column or last to the first column, usually done in quick succession.
* **Shield**: A note that appears in the same column immediately before the beginning of a long note.
* **Split-jumptrill**: A jumptrill which requires the use of both hands at the same time to be performed correctly (i.e two one-handed trills).
* **Stream**: Constant notes with the same interval for at least one beat that do not repeat to create a minijack.
* **Trill**: More than two notes that alternate between two columns without interruption.

## Mandatory

**You must follow all the requirements listed in this section. Failing to meet all the requirements will not allow your map to receive ranked status.**

### Metadata

The following pertains to metadata that your maps contain such as song artists, titles, and tags.

* **The artist and title must be absolutely correct.**
* **The artist and title must be romanized.** However, non-romanized characters are allowed to be used in source and tags.
* **The artist, title and source must not repeat in tags.** However, romanizing or translating the source in tags is encouraged, in case it's relevant.
* **Source must not a website name. It should be filled with album, mixtape, game name, etc.** However, if it comes from youtube, soundcloud and such, source should remain empty.
* **Tags must contain the genre of the song.**
* **Tags must be related to the beatmap and not misleading for search results.** Tags describing the beatmap's style, song content are considered to be related to the beatmap.
* **Guest difficulty creators must be added to the tags of a beatmapset.** Only a registered username ingame or website are valid (using discord name is discouraged due how interchangeable that is)

### Metadata Standardisation

* **Any form of `feat.`, `feat`, `ft.`, etc. must be written as `feat.` when used as an indicator for an artist featured in the song.**
* **Any form of `vs.`, `VS`, etc. must be written as `vs.` when used as an indicator for collaboration between two or more artists.**
* **When a fictional character is credited as the singer of a song, their credit is to be formatted in a `Character Name (CV: Voice Actor)` format.**
* **If a song is used in a television program, web series, or direct-to-video series, such as an opening/ending/insert song, use a `(TV Size)` marker at the end of the current title.**
* **If a song title contains short version or game version markers, the markers must be standardized to `(Short Ver.)` and `(Game Ver.)` respectively.** If the official song released shorter version first before the longer version, then that case could be an exception of this rules.
* **Unofficial cut versions of songs must add a `(Cut Ver.)` marker at the end of the current title.** If an unofficial cut contains matching sections in the same order and is roughly the same length as an official TV size, short version, or game version, it will instead count as an official cut and use the appropriate marker. `Covers` and `remixes` does not count.
* **If a song has been edited to have a higher tempo, use a `(Sped Up Ver.)` marker at the end of the current title.**
* **If a mapset track was contributed to by multiple artists, they may be listed with commas inbetween.** If there are 3 or more contributing artists and they are not part of one officially labelled group, Various Artists or other descriptive artist labels may be used instead.


### Media

The following pertains to media files such as background images and audio files that are contained in your mapset.

* **The resolution of background images must be at least 1280x720** and of exceptionally high quality. The file size of a background image must not exceed 4 MB.
* **The mapset must contain only one audio file.** Multiple song file mapsets are not eligible to be ranked.
* **MP3 is the only allowed audio file format.**
* **The maximum bitrate allowed for audio files is 192kbps.** Check with http://spectro.enpts.com/download.php for the waveforms, refer to this https://homedjstudio.com/audio-bitrates-formats/ article about hertz (hz).
* **The total file size must not exceed 50 MB.**

### Maps

The following requirements are for the individual maps themselves.

* **Autoplay must be able to achieve a 100% (X-Grade) score.**
* **The maps must not have overlapping notes.**
* **All long note releases must have at least 36 milliseconds of space after them.** The value is derived from 2x of the Standard "Marvelous" timing window.
* **The maps cannot have more than 30 seconds of consecutive break time.**
* **More than 75% of the length of the song must have notes to play.**
* **At least one note must be placed in every column.**
* **The maps must be at least 45 seconds long.**
* **The maps must be timed as accurately as possible.** Timing points must not be used in place of scroll velocity changes.
* **The maps must have a song select preview point that sufficently compliments the song.** It's usually placed before the chorus or at the beginning of a section. A solid preview point attracts more players to try the map.
* **BPM lines should not be used abusively for decorations or color changes.** This could be a confusing to players to play and redundant as in filesize.
* **Objects must be snapped to timeline ticks according to snaps.** Use any custom snap as accurate as possible to the song.

### Difficulty Spread

The following pertains to the spread of difficulty each mapset must follow.
Rhythm-related rules and guidelines apply to approximately 160 BPM beatmaps. If your song is drastically faster or slower, some variables might be different, as detailed in Scaling BPM on the Ranking Criteria.

##### Difficulty Names

The standard names for difficulties in a mapset are Beginner, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Expert.
Should you choose not to use the standard names, the difficulty names in your set must show clear sign of progression in difficulty consistent with that of the mapset and should be easy to interpret.

The following descriptions are what each difficulty should typically look like. Keep in mind that this isn't concrete, and there is room for subjectivity in individual cases. It is only to serve a general outlook on how each map should look and feel.

##### Difficulty Spread Rules

| Length        | Minimum Required Maps |
| ------------- | :-------------------: |
| **0:45-2:29** |           2           |
| **2:30+**     |           1           |

##### Skipping Difficulties

You are **not** permitted to skip difficulties for **sets with a song length between 0:45-2:29.** For instance, if you are making a 1 minute set with an Insane, you can either create a Hard or an Expert difficulty. Having a Beginner and an Insane is not allowed. **This rule does not apply to sets with a song length of 2:30 or longer.**

##### Multi-Game Mode Sets

Furthermore, **each game mode is treated separately.** If you are creating a mapset for both 4 Keys and 7 Keys, you must have a difficulty spread for both game modes.

**If you have two game modes, you must preface each difficulty with either "4K" or "7K"** (Example: "7K Insane").

## Guidelines

The following are guidelines to consider when creating your mapset and submitting it for ranked status. **These are not mandatory and it can be broken under special circumstances.** Our intentions with this are to allow mappers to be creative with the types of maps they produce along with clear representation and not getting overmapped. As such, these guidelines are for bridges to increase your chances of getting your mapset ranked.

##### Difficulty Specifics

* **Beginner**
     * For players who are being exposed to rhythm games for the first time.
     * Notes should typically be on every other beat in most cases and once every beat to portray emphasis in the music.
     * Chords are suitable for this difficulty when emphasizing important sounds in the music. However, they should be used sparingly.
     *  **Note density should consist of mostly 2/1, occasional 1/1.**
     * **Avoid chords with more than 2 notes.** However, using a chord at beginning or the end of long note is allowed to use. This applies to 4 and 7 keymode.
     * **Long notes should be held for at least 2/1.** Faster timing release could be difficult for players of this level. Smaller gap between any note require moderate level of finger independence that players of this difficulty barely handle.
     * **Scroll velocity changes should not be used at this difficulty level for any other purposes than scroll velocity normalization.**
     * **Map should not have unsnapped notes**

* **Easy**
     * This difficulty can be thought of as an "upgraded Beginner."
     * Players at this level will be able to play at slightly higher speeds and execute more complicated patterns.
     * One beat streams are generally comfortable to these players.
     * **Avoid using more than 7 consecutive 1/2 notes.**
     * **Note density should consist of mostly 1/1, occasional 1/2.**
     * **Note snappings of consecutive 1/3 and above should not be used.** Slower rhythms are more appropriate for this difficulty level.
     * **Chords can be used occasionally, as players at this level still have trouble with them.**
     * **Avoid using chords during consecutive 1/2 note patterns.** However, using a chord to begin or to end a pattern is fine.
     * **Avoid chords with more than 2 notes.** This includes long note patterns that involve notes in more than two columns. This applies to 4 and 7 keymode.
     * **Scroll velocity changes should not be used at this difficulty level for any other purposes than scroll velocity normalization.
     * **Long notes should have 1/1 duration long at minimum usage.** Shorter duration could make players having hard time to play it accurately.
     * **Map should not have unsnapped notes**

* **Normal**
     * Maps at this level should typically start branching into patterns that don't undermap the song as heavily compared to easy and beginner.
     * 1/2 rhythms with more complicated note placements and jumps are suitable for this difficulty.
     * **Note snappings of consecutive 1/6 and above should not be used.** Slower rhythms are more appropriate for this difficulty level.
     * **Avoid using more than 7 consecutive 1/4 notes.**
     * **Avoid chords with more than 2 notes (3 notes on 7 keymode).** This includes long note patterns that involve notes in more than two columns.
     * **Scroll velocity changes is allowed to be used at this difficulty level.** However, it should be used sparingly and have plenty time reaction to able to play it.
     * **Long notes should have 1/2 duration long at minimum usage.** Shorter duration could make players having hard time to play it accurately.
     * **Map should not have unsnapped notes**

* **Hard**
     * At this level, your creativity as a mapper is able to shine as there are far less restrictions than the previous difficulties.
     * Maps at this difficulty can branch into light 1/4th streams with chords per 1/1 interval during long 1/4 streams.
     * Usage of more long notes are suited for this difficulty, as players will typically be learning to play them in more frequent circumstances.
     * **Avoid chords with more than 3 notes (4 notes on 7 keymode).** This includes long note patterns that involve notes in more than two columns.
     * **1/4 Jack usage is discouraged.** These can be too physically demanding for players of this level.
     * **Note snappings of consecutive 1/8 and higher should not be used.** These can be too physically demanding for players of this level. An exception to this guideline would be the usage of 3 grace notes that are at higher-end snaps (beyond 1/8) as they are only used to accentuate gracing sounds.
     * **Avoid using chords in the middle of 1/6 streams.** However, Using a chord at the beginning or end of a stream is fine.
     * **Long notes should have 1/4 duration long at minimum usage.** Shorter duration could make players having hard time to play it accurately.
     * Scroll velocity changes is allowed to be used at this difficulty with less restriction from Normal, such as light gimmicks without changing the stage snapping.
     * **Avoid anchors consisting of six or more notes.** While they are easy for players to read, longer anchors are quite strenuous or stamina draining.
     * **Avoid unjustified spikes in difficulty. Difficulty should be representative of the song's intensity.**

* **Insane**
     * Players at this level will be able to handle a wide variety of patterns at lower densities including but not limited to:
          * Light Jacks
          * Complex Long Note Usage
          * Light Jumpstreams
     * Denser patterns are suitable for this level.
     * **Avoid unjustified spikes in difficulty.** Difficulty should be representative of the song's intensity.
     * **Avoid using 1/6 or higher snap long note streams.** These are very hard to hit and release because of their very short length. Use regular notes in place of streams instead.
     * **Avoid using chords in the middle of 1/8 streams.** The density of these patterns is often too difficult for players of this skill level, especially when used on the lowest difficulty of a beatmap set. Additionally, ineffective placement of chords may result in inconsistent 1/4 minijack usage. Using a chord at the beginning or end of a stream is fine.
     * **Avoid anchors consisting of eleven or more notes.** Excessive anchors can cause difficulty imbalance and may unfit towards music.
     * **Avoid using more than 9-note split-jumptrills.** These are more physically exhausting than other patterns of similar density.

* **Expert**
     * From this point on, there aren't any restrictions on how hard it should be. Feel free to be creative.
     * **Avoid unjustified spikes in difficulty.** Difficulty should be representative of the song's intensity.

* **The intensity of the map should generally be synced with the music.** If a song is relatively mellow, the map should reflect this and vice versa.
* **Your map should generally make use of layering.** - Mapping to different instruments in the song will make your map reflect the music more.
* **Breaks should only be used when absolutely necessary** - A song will generally not have any silent moments throughout it. Breaks should be used sparingly - especially long ones.
* **Scroll Velocity changes should reflect the music** - Try to avoid changing SV when the must doesn't call for it. This will generally make your map more difficult to read and harder to enjoy.
* **The patterns you use should be consistent and follow the music** - Try to avoid using bursts where they aren't appropriate, such as before a dense stream section. Furthermore, try to avoid technical or intense patterns in places that do not call for them.
