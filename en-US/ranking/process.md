# Quaver Ranking Process

This document outlines the process of getting a mapset ranked starting from uploading the set to getting it reviewed by our Ranking Supervisors.

If you're looking for the criteria a mapset needs to follow in order to get ranked, see: [Quaver Ranking Criteria](/docs/Ranking/Criteria).

## Preface

Our goal with this ranking process is to provide an easy and streamlined approach to getting mapsets ranked. During this process, your maps will be reviewed for coherence with our [Ranking Criteria](/docs/Ranking/Criteria). Before submitting your set for rank, make sure it is following the criteria, as there are cooldown periods in place if your set is denied.

If your mapset is denied for rank, it will be placed on a **14 day cooldown period** before you can submit it again.

## Ranked Status Terminology

There are multiple states that a map could possibly be in related to its process in getting it ranked. They are the following:

### Unranked

When you first upload a mapset, all of your maps will be placed in a state of Unranked. While in this state, your maps will not be eligible to compete for scores on global rankings, but they are still downloadable by the community.

### Pending

When you submit a mapset for ranking, it will be sent to a queue where our Ranking Supervisors will be able to review the set to make sure it aligns with our Ranking Criteria.

### Denied

If you've submitted your mapset, and it isn't eligible to be ranked, it will be placed in a state of Denied. If your set was denied, you will receive comments on it from our Ranking Supervisors about what needs to be changed. While your set is in this state, you will not be able to resubmit it for Pending status for another 14 days

### Blacklisted

Mapsets that are blacklisted are ones that will never be eligible for rank. Sets can get blacklisted if the creator shows no sign of improving their set after multiple denials or their mapset was never in an approaching rankable state to begin with.

### Ranked

If your mapset is deemed to be following our criteria, it will be placed in a state of Ranked. In this state, your maps will be eligible to be competed on in global rankings. While in this state, a map cannot be updated or deleted willingly by the creator.

## The Process

This section outlines the process of getting a mapset ranked from A-Z starting with uploading the mapset itself.

### 1. Uploading The Mapset

The first step in getting a mapset ranked is uploading it. You can do this within the map editor by going to `File -> Upload`.

### 2. Getting Feedback

After uploading your set, it's important to receive feedback on your set before submitting it for rank. This is where the community comes in. While we do not currently have a system in place for getting structured feedback from other players, it is important to have an extra set of eyes take a look at your set to make sure it is following the Ranking Criteria. We'll be looking at making this step in the process more streamlined in the future.

### 3. Submitting For Rank

Players are eligible to submit their own mapsets for ranked status when they feel it is ready. You can submit a set for ranked status by heading over to its page on the website while logged in and clicking the "Submit For Rank" button. This will send the mapset to a queue where our Ranking Supervisors will review it.

### 4. Ranking Supervisor Reviewal

After submitting your set for rank, it will be placed in a queue for the Ranking Supervisor team to review.

In order to get your set ranked, **you will need to get 2 votes from the Ranking Supervisors** that dictates if the set is eligible for rank.

During this vote, **a Supervisor has the ability to veto a mapset from being ranked before it reaches 2 vote and are able place it in a denied state** if there are any issues with the set.

You can check the status of the vote for your set by going to its respective mapset page. Here will be displayed the amount of votes it has as well as the Supervisors who are nominating it for rank.

Once your mapset receives 2 positive votes, it will automatically be placed in a ranked state.

Each mapset is reviewed by our Supervisors in the order that they are submitted to the ranking queue. The sets that contain the highest amount of Supervisor votes at a given time are given priority.

Supervisors are also not allowed to vote for their own mapsets. They must go through the same process as all other users and wait for their respective turn in the ranking queue.

### 5a. Mapset Denied

If your mapset is denied, you will receive a comment from one or more Ranking Supervisors with the reason(s) why. After this period, you are eligible to update your map with fixes to submit again for rank. **Keep in mind that if denied, your set will be placed in a cooldown period for 14 days until you are able to submit it again.**

### 5b. Mapset On-Hold

If your mapset is put on-hold, it means that minor issues were found that prevent it from being ranked. The most common issues are improper metadata or overlapping notes. During this state, any existing supervisor votes will be reset back to zero, and your set cannot be voted for until all issues are resolved. You will need to update your mapset in order for it to go to a status of "Resolved."

### 5c. Mapset Resolved

If the status of your mapset is on-hold, it has to be updated for it to automatically be marked as resolved. While in this state, the supervisors can review and vote for it again. 

### 5d. Mapset Blacklisted

Serious mapsets will rarely be blacklisted. If your set does reach this state, it means that it was deemed to be in a state where you aren't showing signs of improving the set after repeated denials or if it was never in an approaching rankable state to begin with.

### 5e. Mapset Ranked

After this stage, you don't need to do anything else! Your mapset is now ranked and is eligible to play in global rankings.
