# Editor

Quaver comes with a fully featured editor with many different tools to help create your dream map.

## Getting Started

To start using the Quaver Editor, you can use the following methods:
- Clicking the **Editor** button from the Main Menu.
- Right clicking on a map in Song Select and clicking **Edit** from the list of dropdown items.
- Dragging in an mp3 of your choice into the Quaver window.

### Song Metadata

When dragging in a song MP3, you will be prompted to enter in specific information regarding your song.
- Artist - The artist of the song
- Title - The title of the song
- Creator Username - That's you!
- Difficulty Name - What you would like to name this specific difficulty
- Source - Where does the song come from? Could be a Game, a Movie/TV show, or an Album!
- Tags - Helps people search for your song better. Usually it's important to specify the genre of the song in here.

Please enter this information as accurately as possible, especially if you are intending to have your map Ranked.

### Timing A Song

To set the BPM of the song, you can go into **Tools -> BPM Calculator**. This will show you the BPM window, which allows you to tap **T** to the beat of the song,
or manually set the number for BPM. You can also adjust a map's offset here as well.

You can alternatively use the BPM Detector tool in **Tools -> BPM Detector** if you trust the editor to find a suitable BPM. It's not perfect, though, so be ready to
make slight adjustments afterwards.

### Note Placement

Once you've got your song timed, and your metadata set up, you are ready to get to mapping.

- Left clicking on the editor playfield will place a note down.
- Right clicking on the editor playfield will remove a note.
- Using the "select" tool and dragging over multiple notes will select them. You can use this to delete multiple notes (by pressing your "delete" button), 
or copy and paste sections.


## The Editor View
If you take a look around the editor, you will notice there are various windows with tools that the Quaver Editor offers. Let's briefly go over what they provide.

- The **details** window gives you various information about your map thus far.
- The **composition tools** window allows you to change between editing modes. *Select* lets you select various notes and sections. *Note* allows you to place
individual notes down. *Long Note* allows you to place notes and drag to make long notes.
- The **layers** window allows you to create, remove, select, and modify the different layers in your map. Layers are ways of organizing your notes into different
types. For example: You can have a layer for all snare drum beats, and another for the kick, and maybe a third for synth or piano. Making use of layers can help
improve the consistency of your maps!
- The **hitsounds** window gives you the ability to add different sounds to your notes. There are three to choose from: Whistle, Finish, and Clap.

## Additional Features
