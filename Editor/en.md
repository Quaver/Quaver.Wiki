# Editor

Quaver comes with a fully featured editor with many different tools to help create your dream map.

## Getting Started

This section will go into detail on all the basic necessities to get started using the Quaver Editor. 

To start using the Quaver Editor, you can use the following methods:
- Clicking the **Editor** button from the Main Menu.
- Right clicking on a map in Song Select and clicking **Edit** from the list of dropdown items.
- Dragging in an mp3 of your choice into the Quaver window.

**Note: From the Quaver Editor you can go to File -> New Song and select a song file from there to start working on a new song**

### Song Metadata

When dragging in a song MP3, you will be prompted to enter in specific information regarding your song.
- Artist - The artist of the song
- Title - The title of the song
- Creator Username - That's you!
- Difficulty Name - What you would like to name this specific difficulty
- Source - Where does the song come from? Could be a Game, a Movie/TV show, or an Album!
- Tags - Helps people search for your song better. Usually it's important to specify the genre of the song in here.

Please enter this information as accurately as possible, especially if you are intending to have your map Ranked.

### Timing A Song

To set the BPM of the song, you can go into **Tools -> BPM Calculator**. This will show you the BPM window, which allows you to tap **T** to the beat of the song,
or manually set the number for BPM. You can also adjust a map's offset here as well.

You can alternatively use the BPM Detector tool in **Tools -> BPM Detector** if you trust the editor to find a suitable BPM. It's not perfect, though, so be ready to
make slight adjustments afterwards.

### Note Placement

Once you've got your song timed, and your metadata set up, you are ready to get to mapping.

- Left clicking on the editor playfield will place a note down.
- Right clicking on the editor playfield will remove a note.
- Using the "select" tool and dragging over multiple notes will select them. You can use this to delete multiple notes (by pressing your "delete" button), 
or copy and paste sections.

**Note: By default, your editor will place notes slightly above the beat lines. This works well for bar skins, but arrow or orb skins might benefit from centering the objects. You can do this by going to View -> Center Objects**

### Test Playing

Of course when you're ready to try out your map, you can test play it! Click on the bottom right to enter Test Play mode from where you currently are in the editor. You cannot test play if there are no notes from beyond that location.

You can also set additional Test Play modifiers by going to **View -> Test Play Modifiers**

### Adding A Background Image

Every map looks better with a background image! You can add one by dragging an image file into the Quaver Editor window. It will prompt you asking to confirm a background change. Then you have successfully changed the background.

### Song Preview Time

You will most likely want your song select preview sound to be at a specific point in the song. To do this you can go to **Edit -> Set Song Select Preview Time**. This will set the current time you are at as the start of the song preview. 


## The Editor View
If you take a look around the editor, you will notice there are various windows with tools that the Quaver Editor offers. Let's briefly go over what they provide.

- The **details** window gives you various information about your map thus far.
- The **composition tools** window allows you to change between editing modes. *Select* lets you select various notes and sections. *Note* allows you to place
individual notes down. *Long Note* allows you to place notes and drag to make long notes.
- The **layers** window allows you to create, remove, select, and modify the different layers in your map. Layers are ways of organizing your notes into different
types. For example: You can have a layer for all snare drum beats, and another for the kick, and maybe a third for synth or piano. Making use of layers can help
improve the consistency of your maps! **Please note, in order to see layers you must make sure View -> View Layers is checked off.**
- The **hitsounds** window gives you the ability to add different sounds to your notes. There are three to choose from: Whistle, Finish, and Clap. You can enable / disable hitsounds and modify the volume of them from **Audo -> Hitsounds**

## Additional Features

Here are the many features that make Quaver's Editor so robust and unique.

### Playback Speed and Beat Snap

Quaver's Editor allows you to change the speed at which the song is played. This can be found at the bottom bar titled **Playback Speed**. You can also go to **Audio -> Playback Speed**. Here you can adjust at which speed the audio is played in increments of 25, from 25% speed all the way to 200% speed. 100% being the default.

Beat Snap allows you to change how the beats are divided. You can adjust this by holding **CTRL** and moving your mouse wheel, you can also click on the bottom bar which has an option titled **Beat Snap**, or lastly you can go to **View -> Beat Snap Divisor** as well.

### Live Map Preview

You can see how your map will look to a player in real time by going to **View -> Display Gameplay Preview**. This will add a playfield to the right side of the Editor field with an in-game preview of what you have mapped. This is useful if you're mapping Scroll Velocity (SV), which will show you how the SVs look in real time. 

You can *also* press Tab to play your map through the live preview as well if you want to quickly check out how a pattern feels. This will enable / disable autoplay on the live preview.

### Metronome

It is important to make use of the metronome to determine whether or not your song is properly timed. You can turn on and off the metronome by going to **Audio -> Metronome -> Enable**. There is also an option for the metronome to play half beats as well.

## Ranking Your Map

Once your map is finished, you might be looking to try and get it ranked. It's important to follow the [Ranking Criteria](/Ranking/Criteria)
