# Overview #
## Introduction #
### Preface ###
We are unsure if the Ranking Queue System will be a temporary or permanent solution to rank maps. The ranking system is expected to change drastically over the course of the Alpha/Beta stage. The goal of the current system is to get as many decent maps ranked as possible while following a quality standard with a bare amount of staff. This will definitely change in the future, however, to provide a more professional and community-involved experience.
### Purpose ###
The Ranking Queue exists as a filter before maps become ranked on Quaver. Maps will be checked for (i) technical issues such as, but not limited to; overlapping notes, incorrect timing, metadata, and (ii) map quality such as, but not limited to; structural consistency, playability, and layering issues.
### Considerations ###
Although we do not wish the Criteria to be too restricting, we also believe the need for the game to lay down some simple guidelines which can help new charters something to follow by, and for experienced charters to express their creativity. However, some considerations should be made to be made when finding a “middle-ground” between creativity and consistency in standards such as:
- People’s varying perspectives on what a ‘good map’ is
- Risking quality for having lower standards
- Subjectivity (or in the worst case scenario, favoritism)
- What aspects of quality do we have to force, as it is a very subjective issue
## Map Statuses ##
### Ranked ###
Playing ranked maps will record your scores. Achieving scores on these maps will be factored into your Overall Rating and Stats. Freshly ranked maps will be displayed on the front page of the Maps Listings.
### Unranked ###
Unranked maps will not record scores or affect your Overall Rating. You will still be able to download unranked maps through the maps listings. 
### Blacklisted ###
Blacklisted maps will never be able to be entered into the Ranking Queue. Maps will get blacklisted if they are purposefully “bad,” or is an obvious “troll”/”meme.” Maps may also get rejected if the Map Supervisors do not see any attempt from the mapper to improve their map, or if the map has been rejected over a substantial amount of times already.
### Quarantined ###
Quarantined maps are completely removed from maps listing. Players who submit maps that fall under this category will be given appropriate action. 
# Process #
## Nomination ##
Before Nomination
You may choose to nominate your mapset for ranked status once you’ve submitted it. Please make sure your mapset follows the criteria since you may not update your map or remove it from the queue. You are also expected to follow the rules and guidelines when before submitting the map.
## Rules for Nomination ##
Abusing the system could get your account suspended or banned. Please also be mindful that your map does not contain the following violations:
- Maps with heavily distorted our excessively loud audio
- Maps with inappropriate background images or sound
- Maps that contain offensive material

If you attempt to abuse the system maliciously or for personal gain, moderators will take appropriate action. Please make sure that the map you’re submitting follows the general rules as well. You can view the rules here if you are unsure: https://quavergame.com/wiki/Rules/
### Rules for Supervisors ###
While we have expectations for the content that is being assessed, we also expect our supervisors to follow the same standards. Our supervisors will abide by the following rules:
- Supervisors may not rank their own files
- Supervisors may not provide rude, sarcastic, or offensive remarks
- Supervisors will explain why they rejected maps very clearly
- Supervisors must explain clearly what map(s) are being rejected. Rejection of one map will lead to rejection of the whole set

If you notice a Supervisor not following standards or breaking a rule, please contact and admin or moderator directly. Please remember that feedback is typically subjective, but in the end, the Supervisors have the final say in what gets ranked on Quaver.
### Agreement ###
By uploading files to the server, you agree that your map follows our rules and expectations. You agree that you are the original content creator for all the assets, or you got permission from the artists and original content creators. (Original map creators included.) You also agree that your map will be used by the Quaver Team in anyway to market the game or for any competitive scenario.
## Map Queue ##
### Reviewing Process ###
When you nominate your maps for rank status, it will be sent to the Ranking Queue. Supervisors will have the choice to either accept or reject your map if it does not meet their standards, or follow our guidelines. 

A supervisor will provide general subjective feedback if they decide to **Reject** your map. You will not be able to re-submit until a 2-day period has passed. We highly encourage effort to follow feedback provided before re-nominating your maps for ranked.

If your maps are **Approved**, your mapset will gain ranked status.
# Criteria #
## Content-Specific Criteria ##
### Media ###
- Audio is a 192 kbps .ogg file
- Image be appropriately depicting the audio
- Image should be of standard quality, although highly debatable
- No Custom Hitsound should exceed 3 seconds or be excessively loud.
### Metadata ###
Please ensure that your metadata information is correct. If a metadata issue were to be found, your mapset will be rejected. Please ensure that you have appropriate tags set for each map, and that the metadata does not contain non romanized characters where specified.
### Maps ###
Your maps may not have any of the following:
- Overlapping notes and long notes
- 30+ seconds of inactive gameplay during the middle of the song
- More than 75% of the file must have notes to play
## Map Quality Guidelines ###
### Quality Assurance ###
All your maps will be reviewed by the council. Even though all of your maps fully meets the criteria, it may still be rejected by the council if its deemed as low quality or simply not fun. A mapset will be judged as a whole, so even even if a single map does not meet expectations, the whole set will be rejected. There are general guidelines listed below which don’t have to be followed. There are general elements which makes playing a map fun, but of course it depends on context and technique that the mappers used. Utilize these tools provided below to your advantage to make fun and awesome charts!

#### Have Intensity appropriately synced with the music ####
It would not make sense for players to struggle on the most mild part of a song
Vice versa, it would not be fun if the most intense part of the music piece is easy

#### Have a layering structure that makes sense ####
Add chords to represent a group of sounds
Does the song build up? Layer up for different instruments

#### Don’t make people angry ####
Don’t put weird/awkward bursts that don’t make sense. (especially before a dense stream section.)
Try to avoid vibro! 
Try to avoid technical patterns on parts that don’t call for them

#### Use repetition/consistency to your advantage ####
If a song is too repetitive, it will get boring
Make sure your map’s structure and layering is considerably consistent
