# Quaver Ranking Criteria

In order to get a mapset ranked, it must follow the criteria listed below. In the event that it does not, you may be asked to modify your mapset and resubmit it again for rank.

If you're looking for the process of getting a mapset ranked, see: [Quaver Ranking Process](#).

## Mandatory

**You must follow all the requirements listed in this section. Failing to meet all the requirements will not allow your map to recieve ranked status.**

### Metadata

The following pertains to metadata that your maps contain such as song artists, titles, and tags.

* **The artist and title must be absolutely correct.**
* **Tags must contain the genre of the song.**
* **Metadata must not contain non-romanized characters.** If the name of the song is in a different language, use the appropriate English translation.

### Media

The following pertains to media files such as background images and audio files that are contained in your mapset.

* **The total file size of the mapset (.qp) must be 15 megabytes (mb) or smaller**
* **The resolution of background images must be at least 1280x720** and of exceptionally high quality.
* **Your mapset must contain only one audio file.** Multiple song file mapsets are not eligible to be ranked.

### Maps 

The following requirements are for the individual maps themselves.

* **Autoplay must be able to achieve a 100% (X-Grade) score**
* **Your maps must not have overlapping notes.**
* **You cannot have more than 30 seconds of consecutive break time**
* **More than 75% of the length of the map must have notes to play**
* **You must place at least one note in each column**

### Difficulty Spread

The following pertains to the spread of difficulty each mapset must follow.

##### Difficulty Names & Description

These are the standard difficulty names that should be used for mapsets. The names of the difficulties must follow proper naming conventions.

The following descriptions are what each difficulty should typically look like. Keep in mind that this isn't concrete, and there is room for subjectivity for individual cases. It is only to serve a general outlook on how each map should look and feel.

* **Beginner**
     * For players who are being exposed to rhythm games for the first time. 
     * Notes should typically be on every other beat in most cases and once every beat to portray emphasis in the music.
     * Jumps are suitable for this difficulty when emphasizing important sounds in the music.
     
* **Easy** 
     * This difficulty can be thought of as an "upgraded Beginner." 
     * Players at this level will be able to play at slightly higher speeds and execute more complicated patterns. 
     * One beat streams and 1/2 bursts are generally comfortable to these players.
     * Jumps can be used more freely but sparingly, as players at this level may still have trouble with them.
     
* **Normal**
     * Maps at this level should typically start branching into patterns that don't undermap the song as heavily compared to easy and beginner. 
     * 1/2 rhythms with more complicated note placements and jumps are suitable for this difficulty.
     
* **Hard** 
     * At this level, your creativity as a mapper is able to shine as there are far less restrictions than the previous difficulties.
     * Maps at this difficulty can branch into light 1/4th streams with jumps interspersed in them depending on the BPM of the song.
     * Usage of more long notes are suited for this difficulty, as players will typically be learning to play them in more frequent circumstances.
* **Insane**
     * Players at this level will be able to handle a wide variety of patterns at lower densities including but not limited to: 
          * Light Jacks
          * Complex Long Note Usage
          * Light Jumpstreams
     * Denser patterns are suitable for this level if they are straightforward, and not difficult to execute - such as jumptrills.
* **Expert** 
     * From this point on, there aren't any restrictions on how hard it should be. Feel free to be creative. 
* **Custom** 
     * Custom difficulties can be of any difficulty range provided you have the previous ones in your set. They can have custom difficulty names as well.

##### Rules

* **You must include at least beginner, easy, and normal for it to be considered a rankable set, and you may not skip the mapping of a certain difficulty.** Example: You cannot have an Expert difficulty without having mapped an Insane.
* **Any songs under 3 minutes in length require a difficulty spread.** Any maps over 3 minutes in length are considered a "marathon" and can be ranked with a single difficulty
* **Each game mode is treated separately.** If you are creating a mapset for both 4 Keys and 7 Keys, you must have a difficulty spread for both game modes. **If you have two game modes, you must preface each difficulty with either "4K" or "7K"** (Example: "7K Insane").

## Guidelines

The following are guidelines to consider when creating your mapset and submitting it for ranked status. **These are not mandatory and should be taken with a grain of salt.** Our intentions with this are to allow mappers to be creative with the types of maps they produce. As such, these guidelines are merely a way to increase your chances of getting your mapset ranked - although exceptions can be made.

* **The intensity of the map should generally be synced with the music.** If a song is relatively mellow, the map should reflect this and vice versa.
* **Your map should generally make use of layering.** - Mapping to different intstruments in the song will make your map reflect the music more.
* **Breaks should only be used when absolutely necessary** - A song will generally not have any silent moments throughout it. Breaks should be used sparingly - especially long ones.
* **Scroll Velocity changes should reflect the music** - Try to avoid changing SV when the must doesn't call for it. This will generally make your map more difficult to read and harder to enjoy.
* **The patterns you use should be consistent and follow the music** - Try to avoid using bursts where they aren't appropriate, such as before a dense stream section. Furthermore, try to avoid technical or intense patterns in places that do not call for them.
