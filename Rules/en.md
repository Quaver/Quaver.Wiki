# Rules

The following are community rules which users must abide by when playing Quaver. Failure to do so may result in a mute or a ban in severe cases.

### General Rules

These rules apply to Quaver as a whole and what is/isn't acceptable.

1. **Creating multiple accounts is strictly prohibited** - In order to keep a fair ranking environment, users must not create new Steam accounts to access Quaver and must play on the first account they've created.
2. **Account sharing is not allowed under any circumstances** - The only person that should play on your account is you. 
3. **Don't cheat** - Using third-party tools, editing the game client, or exploiting bugs that aren't intended to be in the game is considered cheating. This is a very strict rule and you will be permanently banned without a chance to return.
4. **You must use the official Steam release client when connecting to the game server** - Any editing of the game client for the purpose of logging into our game server is strictly forbidden and you will be permanently banned for doing so. The open source version of the game client is intended to provide developers with a way to contribute to the game in a way that does not affect player integrity. Therefore it is prohibited to use it to connect. 
5. **Use an appropriate username** - Don't use a username that is offensive or with the intent of impersonating someone.
6. **Use an appropriate Steam avatar** - Your avatar in-game is the same as your Steam avatar. Use one that isn't considered NSFW.

### In-game Chat Rules

The following rules apply when using our in-game chat to communicate with others.

1. **Respect Everybody.** - We do not tolerate any condescending remarks, or comments with the intent to humiliate others. Sarcastic remarks are not welcomed here. Please avoid bashing an individual or a whole community. Harassing other users isn't acceptable whatsoever.
2. **Keep it PG-13** - No NSFW/NSFL, gore, pornography, or erotic roleplaying. Nobody wants to see this stuff here. Breaking this rule could result in a ban or mute depending on the severity.
3. **Keep channel discussion relevant** - In-game chat channels are created with topics in mind. Don't gear away from them.
4. **Keep criticism constructive.** - Feedback is welcome as long as it is constructive. This applies to the game itself and 
5. **No advertising, politics, religion, ear rape, spam, raiding, or any unwanted content** - Adverising includes any third-party games, websites, or chat servers. Keep it civil and clean. This is pretty self-explanatory.

### Mapset Submission Rules

The following rules apply when uploading mapset content to our servers.

1. **You must own all the rights or have the right to use ANY content you upload** - This includes but is not limited to: audio and image files, maps, or anything you haven't created yourself. In short - if you're unsure if you're able to use a particular song or graphic, ask the creator. Otherwise do not upload it. 
2. **Plagiarism/copying/stealing maps is not acceptable** - If a map is not your creation (regardless of where or who it came from), do not upload it. Ask the original creator of the map for permission before doing so.
