# Skins
Skins are one of the many great features of Quaver. It allows players to completely customize the look and feel of the game to their liking. With our advanced skinning system, the possibilities of what can be created are endless. 

## Default Skins vs. User Skins ##
Quaver has multiple default skins to choose from which includes bars and arrows for the Keys game modes. It is important to note that when creating user skins, any elements not explicitly specified will be defaulted to the selected default skin. This may cause unintended results, so if you're creating an arrow skin, make sure you have the default arrow skin selected in-game and vice versa.

## How do I create a skin? ##
Skinning has a very forced organization system and needs to be done correctly in order to work properly. The following list are guides to skin each part of the game.

To get started, it'll be helpful to start with a base skin. You can download both our default bar and arrow skins [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/09xjrt71rakztnw/Quaver%20Skins.zip?dl=1).
