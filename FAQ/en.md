# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What state is Quaver currently in?

Quaver is currently in the closed Alpha state. In order to use online features of Quaver, you need to sign up for the Alpha.

### Where can I sign up for the Quaver Alpha?

We announce sign-ups before they open, but until then, you will have to wait. Sign-ups are being held during specific time periods, and are not open at all time.

### Can I play without being part of the Quaver Alpha?

Yes, you can download an offline version from Quaver’s [Github page](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/releases), However, you won’t be able to experience any of the online features.

### Does this mean I can’t download maps from the Quaver website?

That is correct, however, Adri (a member of the Quaver team) offers an alternate download [here](https://rhythmgamers.net/pack/) in the form of map packs for anyone to access. Keep in mind he doesn’t update those packs very frequently.

### Is there an estimate for the public release?

We do not have an estimate for a public release yet.


## Gameplay

### What key modes does Quaver support?

Quaver currently only supports 4 keys and 7 keys.

### Can I import maps from other games?

Yes, Quaver currently supports .osu and .sm files and we are working on increasing the amount of files supported in the near future.

### I have a lot of maps in an external game, can I import them all at once?

It is possible to import all of your maps at once by linking the games “.db” file inside your “quaver.cfg” file, which can be located inside your Quaver folder.

### Can I import my skin from another game?

Yes, you can download a converter by Adri [here](https://rhythmgamers.net/QBC/) and a tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWeLbx48NVI).

### I found a bug, where can I report it?

Any bug reports should be posted on our [Github](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/issues). It doesn't matter how minor you think the issue is. Make sure to post anything you find, but make sure to check for already existing threads to avoid duplication.

### I have a feature request, where can I post it?

Feature requests belong, just like bug reports, on our [Github](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver/issues). Simply choose “Feature Request” when creating a new issue!


## Troubleshooting

### The game doesn’t launch

Make sure Steam is running, as Steam is required in order to launch Quaver. This also applies to the offline build!

### The game is stuck on the welcome screen

If the game doesn’t advance from the welcome screen, there might be a Steam-wide issue. Try again a bit later if this occurs.

### I can’t upload my mapset using the editor

If your mapset fails to upload using the client, you can upload it manually on the [Upload Mapset](/upload/mapset/) page.
